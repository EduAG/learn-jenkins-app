1.-
        I was added a new Docker file named "Dockerfile.aws" 
        where I added the FROM (FROM amazon/aws-cli) 
        installation of aws cli (https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/aws-cli)
        to perform commands of AWS

2.-     In the Jenkinsfile-nigthly I added a new Stage with the Build steps
        to made the "docker build -t my-aws -f Dockerfile.aws ."
        to precharge the image that will be use in the Jenkinsfile

3.-     The creation of the Stage and the steps for AWS in Jenkisn file

        stage('AWS'){
            agent{
                docker{
                    image 'my-aws'
                    reuseNode true
                    args "--entrypoint=''"
                }
            }
            environment {
                AWS_S3_BUCKET = 'learn-jenkins-2024108218'
            }
             steps{
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-aws', passwordVariable: 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', usernameVariable: 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')]) {
                    sh '''
                        aws --version
                        aws s3 sync build s3://$AWS_S3_BUCKET
                    '''
                }   
            }
        }

4.-      Using AWS CLI its necessary to add some credentiasl 
         to interact wit the AWS account, for that nedded I add 
         in IAM Dashboard a new user in the section of permissions options 
         for these case its necessary to Attach policies directly
         AmazonSeFullAccess

5.-     Access Keys: Its neccessary to 
        Create access key the use case Command line 
        interface (CLI) whit these access Key we will extrat the info 
        and in Jenkis we will go to the Credentials section 
        Jenkins>Dashboard>Manage Jenkins>Credentials>System>Global Credentials> Add CRedentials +
